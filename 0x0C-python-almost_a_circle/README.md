Unit testing:
- Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual components or units of code are tested to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
- It involves writing test cases for each unit of code to verify its behavior and expected output.
- Unit testing helps catch bugs and issues early in the development process and provides a level of confidence in the code's correctness.
- Implementing unit testing in a large project involves:
  1. Breaking down the project into smaller, testable units (functions, classes, or modules).
  2. Writing test cases for each unit to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
  3. Using a testing framework (such as pytest or unittest) to organize and run the tests.
  4. Running the tests automatically during development or as part of a continuous integration (CI) process.

Serialization and deserialization of a class:
- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream or a JSON string.
- Deserialization is the reverse process of reconstructing an object from its serialized form.
- To serialize and deserialize a class, you typically need to implement serialization methods or use libraries/frameworks that handle the serialization process for you.
- The specific implementation details depend on the programming language you're using.

Writing and reading a JSON file:
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for storing and transmitting data.
- To write a JSON file, you need to:
  1. Create a data structure (dictionary, list, etc.) representing the data you want to store.
  2. Convert the data structure into a JSON string using a JSON library or built-in language features.
  3. Write the JSON string to a file using file I/O operations.
- To read a JSON file, you need to:
  1. Read the contents of the JSON file using file I/O operations.
  2. Parse the JSON string into a data structure (dictionary, list, etc.) using a JSON library or built-in language features.

*args:
- *args is a special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function.
- It allows you to pass any number of additional arguments to a function, which are collected into a tuple.
- The function can then iterate over the elements in the args tuple or access them by index.

**kwargs:
- **kwargs is a special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.
- It allows you to pass any number of additional arguments as key-value pairs to a function, which are collected into a dictionary.
- The function can then access the values using the provided keys.

Handling named arguments in a function:
- Named arguments (also known as keyword arguments) allow you to pass arguments to a function using their parameter names.
- In most programming languages, you can provide values for named arguments directly in the function call.
- The function can then access the named arguments using their parameter names.
- Named arguments provide clarity and flexibility in function calls, as they make the code more readable and allow arguments to be provided in any order.
