JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as converting a Python data structure into a JSON string.

Deserialization is the reverse process, where a serialized data format is converted back into its original data structure or object.

To convert a Python data structure to a JSON string, you can use the json module's dumps() function.
